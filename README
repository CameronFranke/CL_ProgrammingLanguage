This repository contains the all of the tools and information associated with 
Cameron's Programming Language.

The grammar.ebnf contains the grammar for the language in a modified ebnf format. 
The format is a combination of python regex and the specific syntax required by the 
Grako package. 

The tests folder contain a variety of testcases:
	st = scanner test
	pt = parser test 

clparser.py is the parser projuced by grako. It can be recompiled with the following: 

	"python -m grako --outfile clparser.py grammar.ebnf"

The test driver loads the specified tests, preprocesses them in accordance with 
standard CL practices and feed the text to the parser.
